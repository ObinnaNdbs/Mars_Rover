## Installation
Instructions for setting up the Mars Rover hardware and software are detailed in the [Assembly](https://github.com/ObinnaNdbs/Mars_Rover/tree/main/Assembly) directory. 

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Utilizing GPS data to navigate between waypoints with accuracy.
- **Weather Data Measurement**: Integrating atmospheric sensors to measure and log temperature, pressure, and altitude.
- **PID Control System**: Implementing a robust PID control system for precise movement and steering capabilities.

## Experiment
Found in the [Experiment](https://github.com/ObinnaNdbs/Mars_Rover/tree/main/Experiment) directory.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: The Rover was tasked to navigate through a series of waypoints autonomously, and its ability to maintain the course was evaluated.
- **Weather Data Measurement**: The Rover's sensors collected temperature and altitude data which were then compared to known values from reliable sources.

## Usage
The rover's main functionalities include weather data measurement and autonomous navigation. The rover utilizes a range of sensors to collect environmental data and follows a pre-defined path of GPS waypoints.

## Documentation
Instruction manuals provided to us and the [bin file](https://github.com/ObinnaNdbs/Mars_Rover/blob/main/Documents/00000070.BIN) can be found in the [Documents](https://github.com/ObinnaNdbs/Mars_Rover/tree/main/Documents) directory.
