# Autonomous Navigation through Waypoint

## Overview
This document explores the Mars Rover's performance in autonomous navigation, detailing the setup, execution, and results of navigating a pre-defined path using waypoints.

## Navigation Setup
- **PID Settings**: Configured to optimize path accuracy and minimize deviations from the planned trajectory.
- **Throttle Adjustments**: Calibrated to maintain a balance between speed and control during navigation.

## Path Analysis
- The rover effectively followed the designed path with minimal deviations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the PID tuning in maintaining trajectory accuracy.

## Performance Results
- **Total Time**: Completed the designed path in 14 minutes and 12 seconds.

 - **Distance from Waypoints**: Based on the graph you can see the distance from each point to each way point correlates with that in the pathway.
    - Min: 0.00 m
    - Max: 32.94 m
    - Mean: 13.45 m

## Error Metrics
- **Path Deviation**: There is a deviation in a range of apprioximately +/-2m which correlates with the WP radius of 2m.
    - Min: -2.34
    - Max: 2.32
    - Mean: 0.00

## Suggested Improvements
- Focus on refining PID settings and throttle control to further reduce deviations and improve response times.
- Laying more waypoints help improve the accuracy of the path as the rover will know where to accurately make its next move.
- Inflated rubber tires may also help with rough/bumpy terains as they have better traction and flexibility.
